## About

### How this project began

I wanted to explore the [YC Startup Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) through a map visualization. Since the official [Y Combinator(aka YC) website](https://www.ycombinator.com/) doesnâ€™t currently offer one, I decided to build a version that I would personally enjoy using as an end user.

I started by building a [web scraper](https://github.com/brysonbw/yc-scraper) to collect the data you see on the map.

I used [Google Places (new) API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) to fetch coordinates and addresses for
the companies, enabling them to be plotted on the map.

This project is built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and using [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) for the map.
