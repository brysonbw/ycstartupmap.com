# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
- Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
- Adopting a community/team first mindset.
- Leaning into collaboration and building in public.
- Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
- Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
- Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
- Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
- Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

### Other Restrictions

- Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
- Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting an Issue

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, reach out and [message Bryson on discord](https://discordapp.com/users/805262289119739924).

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Ladder for Code of Conduct Violations

Enforcement ladder is intended to guide appropriate responses based on the nature and impact of the incident.

Community leaders will follow and apply the enforcement ladder guideline in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the ability of Community Managers and/or Leaders to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping with the best interests of our community.
