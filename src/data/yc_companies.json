That’s why our mission at Flexport is to make global trade easy for everyone.\n\nWhat the internet has done for bits and bytes, Flexport is doing for physical goods: giving every business the ability to connect to any customer, wherever they are in the world. That sounds pretty straightforward, but a fragmented and inefficient global supply chain has held the world back from untapped growth and innovation. By connecting everyone in the global economy we can unlock commerce, creativity, and human progress.\n\nTo do so, we’re building the platform for global logistics—empowering buyers, sellers and their logistics partners with the technology and services they need to grow and innovate. \nToday, we work with more than 40,000 customers and their suppliers across industries like manufacturing, retail, electronics, consumer goods, tech, apparel, and beauty. Companies of all sizes—from emerging brands to Fortune 500s—used Flexport technology to move nearly $19B of merchandise across 112 countries in 2021.\n\nInterested in joining our team?

    "description": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses.",
    "about": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses. Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \n\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \n\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\n\nOver the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \n\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 - The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\n\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money.",

It’s an excellent, cost effective way to commute, used by hundreds of thousands of Americans, but the industry is largely offline. It’s difficult to find, join, and start vanpools. \n\nWe build software that fixes this, making vanpooling simple and flexible. We believe that in a post Covid world, it will be more important than ever to rethink shared transportation and make it more adaptive.\n\nOur customers are organizations like transit agencies and employers who have existing vanpool fleets. We provide these customers with our SaaS platform that manages their vanpool programs. We capture real time information about open seats, then make those seats available to book through our app. We also make it easy for people to crowdsource and start new vanpools.",

In addition, the team made news when Cancer Physicians who sit on the committee for patient treatment guidelines (NCCN) presented a clinical study using Cofactor’s technology showing superiority in predicting the patients who will respond to immunotherapy. This initial application is an acute problem recognized widely in the rapidly developing immunotherapy industry and represents north of a billion dollar TAM. \n\nAfter a number of recent key milestones, the team is taking the technology more broadly to 50% of cancers diagnosed in the US. \n\nCurrent investors include Menlo Ventures, DCVC, and Ascension Ventures (this last investor representing the funding arm for 13 National U.S. Healthcare Systems).",

Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.\n\nThis process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.\n\nWe charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).\n\nIt encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.\n\nOn average, defect rate will fall 75% within 5 months of deploying Assembly at a factory.",

Planning your trip should be a joy, not a chore! We help people to travel responsibly, by booking direct instead of using traditional booking sites. Travellers get the best price and they help local businesses avoid unnecessary fees. \n\nTravel experts, content creators and the friends you always ask for recommendations can use The Guide to showcase their favourite places to stay and things to do. When you book one of their recommendations, you’ll get a discount from the business and they receive bonus credit to say thanks.\n\nThe Tab platform gives independent tourism businesses the tools to improve their online presence, be discovered, take direct bookings — and also to take payments. Our payment platform is uniquely designed for tourism businesses, handling over 100 currencies natively, and every payment type securely and easily.\n\nAs travel returns after a difficult period, it’s time for a fresh approach. That’s why we’re building a social commerce platform for tourism — helping to spread the benefits of tourism far and wide, and helping travellers make the most of their precious time abroad. \n\nWe're headquartered in London, and backed by Y Combinator (the investors behind Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe).",

Today, Resolve helps bridge the communication gap between people who operate buildings and those who design and build them. We've built the most robust application for collaboratively reviewing complex facilities on the web and on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest. Our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.\n\nFrom data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.\n\nOur customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

Our mission is to make clean drinking water available to everyone, everywhere.\n\nWe create stainless steel water bottles, and each bottle funds 5 years of clean water for someone in Africa. When you get a GiveMeTap bottle, you also have access to the free-water network of cafes and shops who give free tap water to people on the go. No questions, no hassle.\n\nWe build water projects in remote villages and elect a water committee to run the maintenance of the water. So far we have made an impact in Namibia, Malawi, and Ghana to bring clean water for the first time.\n\nWe like to think of this as ‘Water for You, Water for Everyone’.\n\nWe help awesome companies create custom bottles for their staff, customers, and events so that they can stay hydrated, reduce plastic waste and help fund water projects. Our partners include:\n\nDeloitte\nHSBC\nYCombinator\nGoogle\nTED\nFlexport\nLegal & General\nRichard Branson's The Lodge, Switzerland\nCambridge University \n\nWant to get your company involved?

In order to afford utilities, families often forgo medication, food, and transportation. The Human Utility's platform divides a bill similar to a loan syndicate expanding the possible number of donors from around the world able to join together to ensure families never lose access to utility service. Donors are matched with a specific family or donate to a universal assistance fund.\n\nLater, we use utility data to design interventions addressing the root causes of why people need help with their utility bills with the goal of never having them lose service again.",

    "about": "Mezmo, formerly LogDNA, is an observability platform to manage and take action on your data. It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases.\n\nMezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\n\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\n\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\n\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.",

We have developed a windshield protection film product line called ExoShield to help vehicle owners protect their windshields. Our ExoShield GT3 film is sold through 400+ aftermarket installers and car dealerships in 56 countries that carry and install it for vehicle owners. For Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco owners (google: broken windshield club), our ExoShield ULTRA DIY kits are available via our website and dropshipping partners. \n\nDefense - Over the last 3 years, we have been working with the Canadian Armed Forces to develop an infrared camouflage technology. We have received two contracts from CAF to develop our technology. Our solution has the ability to be integrated into the uniform directly (adding just 5-10g of weight vs. 600-18,000 kg of weight for other alternatives), has outperformed all existing NATO alternatives in multiple CAF field trials, and is receiving support from major elements of CAF for our next contract. This technology can also be adapted for other individual camouflage integrations (face paint and individual nettings) and for mobile camouflage applications (vehicle nettings and vehicle paints).",

IPFS is a protocol for storing, addressing, and transferring data, designed to replace HTTP in many contexts. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify and link to information. IPFS is one of the leading protocols of Web3, crypto, and the decentralized web movements. IPFS serves millions of end users and tens of thousands of developers. It powers the websites and applications of small startups, large enterprises, and even blockchains.\n\nFilecoin is a decentralized storage network, designed to store humanity's most important information. Filecoin is a cryptocurrency incentivized decentralized market, where storage providers earn filecoin tokens for renting out storage space. (Think airbnb for cloud storage). Filecoin is one of the leading projects in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space.",

Earn some extra cash.\nLet backpack help you save that high shipping cost or earn a little extra.\n\nBackpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. \nEach backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.\nTravelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a \"backpack request\" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they \"request backpack\" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money. \n\nbackpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.\nWhether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps. We would like to reject the counterfeits, we would like to reject the almost-originals, most importantly, we would like to not pay the heavy expense incurred, most of which we deem to be superfluous. Help us make a better, more original globalized world.",

The end game is to educate a whole new generation of computer programmers that started their journey by slaying ogres and defending their castles from oncoming enemy hordes.\n\nWe teach Python, JavaScript, and other languages directly in the browser. Teachers with no computer science background can get started in five minutes.

    "about": "Lawdingo gets people in touch with a lawyer very quickly.\n\nLawdingo gives people seeking legal services direct access to independent lawyers who can help them. Such attorneys usually have more flexible hours, lower rates, and greater interest in customer service than to their larger firm counterparts. The problem is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. \n\nIf you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. \n\nWe also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch. \n\nLawdingo was started by Nikhil Nirmel (nikhil@lawdingo.com), an entrepreneur with a background at Yelp and Wharton Undergrad, and Dan Langevin , a ridiculously talented technologist who was formerly CTO of Lifebooker. Lawdingo has backing from Y Combinator and other investors.",

By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.\n\nTang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",

On iPhone, a tiny USB-C plug-in (“Bud”) provides precise input control so Blue can act on your behalf.

Additional, in most languages typing is really hard/slow. As a result, text-interfaces (apps and websites) haven't worked in emerging markets. Voice AI can fix this, and onboard 100s of millions of new users to the internet for the first time. \n\nBut current Voice Models suck... After the top 5 languages, the models are so bad you can't make any Voice product on top of them. We are fixing this by creating state of the art models for regional languages. \n\nWe are able to do this coz we created unique data gathering and labeling methods to solve for small languages. We already have SOTA models in multiple languages (like Balochi, Sindhi).\n\nWe are on a mission to uplift entire nations through better access to digital information and digital services. \n\nTeam:\nOur team has previously created Voice technology used by millions daily. We worked on Alexa and Siri; And have launched entire AWS services like AWS Bedrock Guardrails.\n\nWe do in-house research and development. We gather our own data, then train and deploy our own models. We own our technology stack end-to-end.",

    "about": "Food Supply Chain companies have been using legacy ERPs for decades. Everyone knows these are necessary evils that essentially run the business but take up a lot of operational capacity. They are not about to just rip and replace their existing system that runs their whole business with a system that takes years to implement. Imagine if they could implement AI that runs the ERP for them, in weeks?\n\nBurnt’s building an agentic OS for the Food Supply Chain with AI Agents for each department. \n\nOur AI Agent, Ozai, has started by replacing the whole order management job function at food distribution companies, so that sales and customer service teams can focus on what matters - the customer. Ozai monitors all incoming messages (emails, phone calls, voicemails, whatsapp, fax etc.), figures out if it's an order, learns each customer's habits, shorthand, and favorite products, picks up on any prep notes, and enters it straight into the existing ERP. It'll even go back to the customers on your behalf when it's not sure about something, clarify things and carry on working. \n\nThe more it sees, the smarter it gets.",

We are now live with the U.S. Department of Education, a regulatory reform PAC in South Carolina, and have a pipeline of several additional state and federal agencies and major enterprises.\n\nOur initial agency partners use legal cartography to draft lawful regulations, respond to public comments on regulations, and instantly generate mandatory cost-benefit analyses.\n\nWe have both public and private sector visions. In the public sector: we endeavor to automate the entire regulatory process end-to-end; replacing the consulting industrial complex with software. In the private sector: we plan to automate regulatory compliance, tackling the $4 trillion regulatory cost on the U.S. economy.",

    "about": "RowFlow is like if Typeform or SurveyMonkey started as an AI company. We replace clunky web forms with natural conversations that run over text, slack, or wherever your users are. Our platform aims to double your form’s response rates while cutting your internal overhead in half. \n\nWith RowFlow, you can take any existing form and instantly convert it into an AI-powered conversation. New flows launch in minutes and reach respondents over your preferred channel or embedded chat. We guide the exchange, follow up automatically, and return clean structured data without extra work from your team.\n\nForms power billions of business interactions yearly. Whether it’s forms for client intake, registrations, compliance, feedback, or surveys, they all follow the same painful pattern: low conversion, messy data, and frustrated users. Teams have long tolerated forms only because there's been no scalable alternative for collecting structured information from people - until now. Our goal is for RowFlow to become the new default way for how organizations collect user data in an AI-first world.",

Now we put that into an open-source framework, so others wouldn’t have to do the same from scratch.\n\nModelence is a batteries-included framework that abstracts away boilerplate so you can just focus on building your product logic and nothing else - it’s like Next.js + Vercel + Supabase on a single platform, built for full-stack TypeScript.\n\nShipping production apps is much harder than building a prototype that runs locally and 95% of all production apps share the same building blocks. We did a massive amount of work on our previous platforms that was not specific to our product, and we’ve created Modelence to abstract that away:\n- Authentication\n- Database setup\n- Hosting / CDN\n- AI integration (LLM observability, prompts)\n- Real-time events\n- Cron jobs\n- Email service\n- Monitoring\n- Analytics\n- Admin dashboards\n\nAndrej Karpathy recently posted about this same exact problem:\nhttps://x.com/karpathy/status/1905051558783418370\n\nand explained it further in his YC AI Startup School talk:\nhttps://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?feature=shared&t=1940",

    "about": "Magnetic scans client documents - from handwritten charity notes to excel spreadsheet Schedule Cs to multi-state K-1s - and enters them into tax software automatically, saving hours of tedious data entry. \n\nThe accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\n\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\n\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\n\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\n\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

    "about": "Fleetline is building the first complete-context algorithmic load planner for mid to large-sized trucking fleets. Today’s dispatchers face an overwhelming task: balancing regulations, customer demands, live fleet data, and individual driver needs, all while coordinating across siloed tools and teams. Mistakes run rampant, and each mistake is thousands of dollars. Even the select fleets using algorithms that have fleet-wide context struggle: the outputs are rigid, hard to interpret, and are blind to real-world nuances like driver preferences and schedule exceptions. Fleetline solves this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can easily adapt algorithms to each fleet’s needs and capture driver-specific information. The result is smarter planning truly optimized for every fleet and its drivers.",

Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\n\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With backgrounds in both enterprise engineering (Rheinmetall, dSPACE) and building web apps used by thousands, we have the unique blend of discipline and product sense needed to build this.\n\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\n\nOur vision is to empower anyone to create well-designed applications, regardless of their technical skill. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built. stagewise will enable non-technical stakeholders - product managers, designers, and marketers - to directly iterate on the UI themselves, creating a new, collaborative workflow and making us the essential tool for building on the web.",

    "about": "dScribe AI uses autonomous drones and 3D vision to track bulk inventory. We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.\n\nBulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\n\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\n\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.",

    "about": "Certus AI is replacing the restaurant phone line with Voice AI.\n\nRestaurants lose up to $100,000 per year per location from missed calls, lost orders, and abandoned hold lines. Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\n\nIt’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\n\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\n\nWe’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.\n\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\n\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\n\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\n\nOur customers say it best:\n\n- “Certus changed my life overnight.”\n- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”\n- “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”\n- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”\n- “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”\n\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.\n\nAnd in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

    "about": "Locata is an AI referral management platform for Health Centers. We deploy AI agents to automate every step of the referral process that back-office staff face daily, from submitting authorizations to broadcasting updates and following up with patients. This frees up staff to focus on patient care.\n\nPrimary Care back-offices are severely understaffed and overburdened by administrative work associated with referrals. Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\n\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in CS. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in CS, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google, developing AI products that served over 1 billion users.\n\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and are implementing our system to automate their entire referral workflow.",

Powered by fine-tuned Verilog LLMs, reinforcement learning, and real compiler feedback, SigmanticAI iteratively refines code until it compiles and passes synthesis, no matter how complex the design. It’s like the Cursor for HDL design. \n\nIn addition to code generation, SigmanticAI can generate token-level annotations and onboarding documents to accelerate ramp-up for new engineers. With support for both cloud and on-prem deployment, it integrates with existing EDA tools to dramatically reduce debug time, improve collaboration, and accelerate hardware design across teams",

F4 ensures design engineers never release noncompliant drawings—and suppliers never misinterpret them. We help hardware teams eliminate costly scrap, rework, and miscommunication at the root.\n\nWith a compliant drawing, F4 generates end-to-end drawing interpretations for standard definitions, inspection plan, and tolerance analysis application.\n\nF4 automatically interprets all GD&T symbols, datums, and notes based on the correct standards - no more second-guessing or misreading intent. Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\n\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\n\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, including the critical stack-up paths, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.",

    "about": "𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐰𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬:\nI (Angel) have had three knee surgeries since my mid-teens and was billed more than $250K for care that should have cost a fraction of that. Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\n\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:\n• Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\n\n• Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\n\n• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\n\n• Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\n\n𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued. We catch nuanced billing, coding, and contract errors to save 3-7% on annual claims spend. We work with self-insured employers and health plans.\n\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐔𝐬:\nAngel Onuoha (CEO) and Ahmad Shehu (CTO) have worked together for 4 years. Before Avelis Health they built Zuvy, a Lagos-based fintech company that provided invoice factoring to small businesses. Zuvy was acquired by The BAS Group in 2025.",

    "description": "The easiest and most powerful way to build apps with AI.",
    "about": "Floot lets non-coders & entrepreneurs build real web apps that actually work. We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI. Since June, 3000+ users have created over 4000 apps on Floot.\n\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\n\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\n\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\n\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\n\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\n\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\n\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \n\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\n\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\n\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution.",

    "about": "Perseus Defense is building a mass-manufactured Counter UAS solution for the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our self-guided missile platform is man-portable and multi-domain capable. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement over existing kinetic solutions. \n\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued their PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \n\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\n\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \n\nTraction: \nJason and Steve used more than 100 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. In 8 short weeks following a strict 2-week design-build-test cycle, the team has gone through 4 major guided missile iterations with over 30 live-fire flight tests. They were invited to Ft. Hood to present their platform to the 1st Cavalry Division, and also briefed the Pentagon and U.S. congressmen on current U.S. vulnerabilities to advanced drone technology. Perseus Defense is actively standing up cooperative research agreements with U.S. Army DEVCOM's Applied Research Laboratory, Aviation and Missile Center, Armaments Center, and High Performance Computing Modernization Program.",

So that's exactly what we're helping companies achieve; we started building a few weeks ago and are working with our design partner to get deep observability and insights into their agent executions.\n\nThe future is autonomous; AI agents will be everywhere.

With the latest image classification and reasoning models, we can match products across merchants—even when listings and images differ—recognize variants, and surface the perfect matches for every search. As we grow, we’ll capture unique insights into what users want, click, and buy.\n\nAs AI models get smarter and cheaper, our flywheel accelerates: our catalog will improve, and it will be even easier for developers and vibe-coders to build on our infrastructure. To further incentivize building on Channel3, we provide built-in monetization; developers earn commissions on sales they drive.\n\nAlex discovered this need while building an AI tutor that could recommend products and earn affiliate revenue.

    "about": "Stockline is reshaping ERPs to bring innovation to a $990B+ industry left behind by the tech revolution: the food supply chain.\n\nFood wholesalers still rely on software from the 90s. One symptom among many: they waste hours retyping orders and invoices that arrive through scattered channels like WhatsApp, SMS, and email into their ERPs. Manual admin work takes over. Headcount grows just to handle repetitive tasks.\nThis leads to mistakes, tight margins, and food waste.\n\nStockline replaces outdated ERPs with AI at its core. The game-changer? No more manual data entry. Our AI pulls orders from every channel and feeds them directly into one unified system.\n\nAdmin disappears. Wholesalers get to focus on what really matters: their products and their customers.",

We let organizations instantly find any object, behavior or event, in any footage, without needing to train a model or collect any training data.\n\nThe Pain: Creating vision models usually takes months: collecting training data, training, then deployment. Worse yet: \n+ it’s often impossible to get enough data for a specific task, and \n+ even the best cv models struggle to generalize across diverse camera setups, workflows and environments. \n\nTo overcome these blockers, we bet early on the power of VLMs and built a vision engine that can generalize across any task and doesn’t need any training data. We published a NeurIPS workshop paper showing our new methods with VLMs beat traditional CV even at niche tasks.\n\nOur current customers include:\n- National Defense Organizations\n- Robotics Research\n- Security cameras\n- Behaviour analysis for port monitoring\n- Off-shore oil & gas monitoring",

    "about": "Alter is a zero-trust identity and access control platform purpose-built for AI agents. It wraps every tool call in strong authentication, fine-grained authorization, and real-time guardrails, so agents can move fast without breaking things.\n\nEach request is verified at the parameter level, authorized against granular policies, executed with least-privilege access, and fully audited in real time. Unsafe actions, whether it’s a rogue DROP TABLE or a payment above policy limits, are blocked before they touch production. Behind the scenes, Alter manages credentials, issuing ephemeral, scope-narrowed access for every interaction, then rotating or expiring it in seconds. The result: no long-lived secrets, no blind spots, and no surprises in audit.\n\nWith Alter, teams can move fast on AI agent initiatives while staying fully compliant with SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and internal security standards. A CISO-ready dashboard delivers real-time visibility, detailed audit logs, and compliance-ready controls, removing silos, eliminating excessive permissions, and providing complete oversight of every agent workflow.",

    "about": "Cyberdesk is the computer use agent for developers to automate legacy desktop apps. \nFor example, one of our customers is building an AI agent for hospital patient intake, and they’re using us to automate an entire team of people manually clicking and typing into a desktop app to book appointments. \n\nWe launched mid July and we’ve closed 164k ARR. Our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.\n\nWe’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\n\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \n\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He later bootstrapped a consumer AI startup to 50k in ARR.\n\nCyberdesk is already automating tasks that have been typically handled by business process outsourcing teams (BPO) teams, and we're doing so for 20% of the price. The BPO market is a $300B market, which represents a $60B opportunity.\n\nWe’d love to talk with you for a demo!\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

It turns natural language into powerful spatial analysis, styling, and workflows with no GIS expertise required.\n\nWorking with geospatial data today is slow, fragmented, and deeply technical. Simple tasks often require desktop based software and coding expertise. Most platforms rely on outdated desktop software, steep learning curves, and disconnected tools. Even simple tasks like uploading data, running a buffer, or visualizing zones can take hours and require specialists.\n\nMonarcha changes that.\nWe connect directly to your data, enrich it with public datasets, understand spatial context, and let you run 50+ spatial tools instantly on the map. Upload vector or raster files, run PostGIS SQL queries, generate heatmaps, clip zones, and more all with a simple prompt. We're giving everyone the power of advanced spacial analysis to help save time, money and unlock siloed geospatial data across entire organizations. \n\nWant to learn more? Check out monarcha.ai",

    "about": "We help companies build reliable AI agents through an evaluation harness that learns over time using human feedback. \n\n1. The problem:\n\nCurrent offline eval methods are high-friction, a lot of work is needed to continuously curate labeled data, write experiments and evaluators. \n\nOn the other hand, current LLM judges are static and often have terrible performance, they lack context on how they fail and the nuances of the task at hand. \n\n2. The solution:\n\nWe're building new evaluation tools that provide signal faster and of higher quality than traditional evals.\n\n- Calibrated Judges: LLM Judges that learn from their mistakes and get better over time.\n\n- Autotune: Automatic evals with dozens of models and optimization (genetic prompt tuning & sft).\n\n- Arenas: Pairwise comparison and ELO rankings of agents with subjective outputs like UI generation, motion design, etc.\n\nDo you have tool call failures? Hallucinations? Outputs that you don't like? Talk to us.",

Pharmacies can get 50+ phone calls a day, and missing phone calls means lost revenue from filling prescriptions.\n\nPharmacy workflows are complex and custom to each pharmacy's needs. Generic tools are not enough, which is why AI agents can handle tasks end-to-end that previously could not be automated. We are constantly evolving Pharmie to become a suite of agents that supercharge your pharmacy.\n\nIn the future, pharmacies will evolve into patient care centers, bridging the gaps in access caused by today’s overburdened healthcare system. Successful pharmacies will use AI to optimize their operations, resulting in a higher quality patient experience traditional pharmacies cannot match.",

    "about": "Shor is a new Employer-of-Record built from the ground up with AI agents and stablecoins. We enable remote teams to hire and pay global employees at a fraction of the cost. The process is fast, simple, and fully compliant.\n\nToday, global payroll is broken. Payments take days, cost 5–10% in fees, and force companies to navigate complex banking, tax, and labor regulations. Platforms like Deel and Rippling solved this for large enterprises but remain too expensive and cumbersome for the millions of startups and growing remote teams scaling globally.\n\nShor fixes this by combining autonomous AI agents with stablecoin-based settlement. Our agents handle contracts, worker classification, compliance, and payroll automatically in a simple, messaging-first experience. Payments can settle in seconds rather than weeks at a fraction of the cost of legacy providers.\n\nWe are making global payroll fast, affordable, and accessible for the millions of companies left out by legacy platforms.",

A productive AI agent must similarly learn how to use our computers, browsers, and software to deliver real world value. \n\nToday, browser and computer use AI is inaccurate, slow, and expensive. Model labs and enterprises who want to improve these agents are bottlenecked by two resources: \n\n1) High quality datasets for benchmarking and evaluations\n2) Realistic sandbox environments for safe and accurate testing/training (ex. a simulated version of Salesforce) \n\nHalluminate offers a suite of products and services to address both these issues. \n\nOur evaluation service combines proprietary datasets with high quality annotations to help our customers identify and prioritize the biggest failure modes of their computer- and browser- use AI. \n\nOur platform provides a catalog of fully managed sandboxes, empowering our customers to safely and accurately test/train at scale, resulting in improved performance. \n\nOur customers see\n- Improved browser- and computer-use agent performance\n- New and emergent frontier agent capabilities\n- Data driven prioritization leading to exponentially faster development speed\n- Increased revenue/sales via marketing from public benchmarks\n\nOur paying customers already include leading computer use model labs and the two largest browser agent companies in the space. \n\nWyatt and Jerry are friends that met their first week of school studying CS at Cornell University.

Feel free to reach out: founders@acrely.ai\n\nWe provide home service business owners with voice AI to capture every inbound call and turn it into booked jobs.\n\nMeet Jane, your AI-powered customer service rep. When a customer calls and no one answers, Jane does. She talks naturally with callers, understands their problem, and books the job, whether it’s a leaky pipe, an AC repair, or a new installation.\n\nHome services are still phone-first, but owners lose thousands each month to missed calls and overwhelmed CSRs. Every truck, website, and yard sign funnels calls in, yet too often they go to voicemail or get dropped. Jane makes sure the real jobs, the ones that pay, never slip through.\n\nWe’re starting by solving inbound, the single most expensive leak in the business. With Jane, contractors never miss a call, never lose a customer to voicemail, and finally have a CSR that works 24/7 without turnover or breaks.",

From Ford Trucks to NASA Space Shuttles, sheet metal is the cornerstone of American Manufacturing - but the industry runs on 30-year-old technology and a shrinking workforce.\n\nAlessio and Vedic competed in high school robotics when they met Jakob at Georgia Tech's Robotics labs. After witnessing Vedic's father's 12-hour shifts and visiting manufacturers across the US, they saw an industry trapped by legacy constraints: manual processes, skilled labor shortages, and unused automation.\n\nSAVA is building a fully integrated manufacturing system that eliminates skilled operators while delivering superior speed, quality, and economics. They're already reducing customer iteration cycles from 5-6 days to 1-2 days for companies like Pave Robotics - proving the technology works in real production environments.\n\nThey're not just replacing human operators with robots - they're building the foundation to replace an entire industry built on outdated technology with modern manufacturing intelligence.",

Zero downloads. Zero setup. Just pure ambient group genius.\n\n🍕 \"Find pizza spots we'll ALL actually like\" (remembers Sarah's gluten-free, Jake's spice tolerance, everyone's budget)\n🎉 \"Plan something epic for Saturday\" (knows the group's energy, who's free, what you actually enjoy)\n🔥 \"Roast my terrible movie suggestion\" (adapts to your group's humor style and inside jokes)\n\nEvery group chat gets its own brain. Every friend gets understood. Every plan actually works.\n\nThe future isn't prompt → response.\nIt's presence → understanding → creation.\n\nTry it now. Your friends will thank you.",

Engineers and technicians scramble, chasing PLC data and logs, flipping through manuals and troubleshooting guides, while production stalls.\n\nLineWise connects siloed data from PLCs, maintenance logs, and machine manuals to triage potential causes for the issue at hand. Once the issue is resolved, LineWise will remember everything for the next time and advocate preventative actions.",

Security teams don't need more dashboards with \"AI-powered insights\" — they need their time back.\n\nCotool empowers teams to build security their way. Our platform provides an AI co-pilot that automatically assembles context across tools, a no-code agent builder that transforms successful investigations into reusable automations, and automated report generation, providing comprehensive documentation in seconds.\n\nUnlike solutions that force teams to adapt to vendor workflows, Cotool puts the power of AI directly in practitioners' hands, letting them shape tools around their unique processes. Early users have already cut time spent on investigation and detection engineering by 70%.",

MindFort agents use the same principles as human penetration testers to understand their target and figure out the best ways to work together to exploit it.\n\nWhile security teams were already behind with legacy tools and processes, AI coding is make the problem worse. AI generates code far faster than human teams can secure it; MindFort can match that speed and scale. Our agents will become critical as organizations scale up development with AI.",

We enable businesses to deliver their most critical items same-day.\n\nTime-Critical Logistics is a $30B market growing at a 20% CAGR driven by growth in American healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nBusinesses that place time-critical orders are enterprises who have urgent items they need to deliver ASAP. These orders are critical in nature and often require white glove service -- think therapeutic treatments for healthcare providers or specialized equipment for manufacturers. \n\nchrt provides a marketplace of professional couriers who pick up and deliver these orders. We build the software these couriers use to handle the shipments, including a driver app and fleet management tools. This gives us full control of the shipment and allows us to provide shippers with end-to-end tracking. It also allows us to intervene early if we notice something is going wrong.\n\nWe’re software engineers that became friends years ago at McKinsey. Kyle is an expert in Time-Critical Logistics, having led strategy at a leading startup in the space. Aaron is an expert at designing and implementing AI systems to handle complex coordination. We were shipping code together on nights and weekends for years before chrt; now we’re also shipping freight.",

They’re dashboards — not thinking tools.\n\nSo we built Scalar Field to change that: a platform where users can test any market hypothesis instantly using intelligent agents.\n\nYou can spin up agents that react to market events, run backtests across data from multiple asset classes, and even trigger trades when specific conditions are met — all in one place.",

Ayna and Andy, the co-founders, met during their time at Harvard and started this in 2024 as their programs were wrapping up. We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \n\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams. We already have two paying customers in the OEM and system integrator spaces. \n\nWe are venture backed and supported by a GBP 2.5MM grant by ARIA, the UK Government's invention agency.",

    "description": "AI powered data annotation",
    "about": "Spin up your own data annotation platform in 60 seconds!\n\nHigh-quality, human-reviewed data is essential for improving AI models. Yet, many teams still use outdated tools or spreadsheets that aren’t built for complex data from LLMs and AI agents. This slows down iteration, drives up costs, and makes model performance unpredictable in real-world use.\n\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly. Simply paste or stream any type of raw data—text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs—and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow. Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.\n\nKey differentiators\n1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.\n2. Tailored guidelines – Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation – AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment – On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.\n5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.\n\nToday we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more. For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\n\nBesimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.\n\nReach out!\n\nIf you’re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data —or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail—let’s talk. We’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.",

QualGent helps teams scale QA effortlessly and avoid Sonos-level disasters.\n\nThe idea for QualGent was born from the founders’ experience leading engineering teams at Google across Android XR, Stadia, Quick Share, and foldable devices where shipping to billions of users meant constantly facing the painful trade-off between moving fast and maintaining quality. With prior research experience at Nvidia, Maryland, and Berkeley, the team saw a clear opportunity: use AI to scale QA.\n\nQualGent’s vision is to close the loop on software creation. As AI enables engineers to code 100x faster, QualGent eliminates the next bottleneck—software verification—unlocking truly scalable, end-to-end software development.",

We combine AI Agents with human experts to deliver hyper-personalised campaigns that consistently generate six-figure qualified pipelines.\n\nSince 2023, throxy has powered outbound for B2B companies, from industrial manufacturers to fintech providers, replacing the need for internal SDR teams or heaps of tools, with a solution that outperforms in both speed and quality.\n\nOur founding team has built AI at JP Morgan, scaled businesses from age 14, and led enterprise sales from Seed to Series D. We’re not just automating outbound, we’re redefining what sales execution looks like in traditional industries.\n\nthroxy is the AI SDR purpose-built for the sectors software forgot.",

Ryan built pricing software after seeing the mess first-hand. We’ve turned that pain into a product.\n\nSince launch, we’ve onboarded $3M+ in ticket inventory, signed up 100+ paying sellers, and started working with pro teams. We charge 10% per ticket sold. This is our wedge into the $26B resale market.\n\nOther platforms cost you money. We make you more of it.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\n\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\n\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\n\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

    "about": "Tinfoil makes it easy to make your AI workloads provably private, without changing your code. You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\n\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \n\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \n\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\n\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable. By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\n\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

There we realized AI can completely disrupt the $50B Work Management Market, but it required a fresh start.\n\nWhat work we even choose to manage in the first place is critical, and the most important insights from customers are silo-ed in sales/CS while R&D gives their best shot at roadmaps meant to deliver impact. Significant requests sit in a backlog, duplicate asks flood the system, months wasted on \"strategic investments\". We want to bridge this gap.\n\nThis message is resonating with heads of sales, heads of product, CEOs, as well as individuals, all trying to make sure the most important things get done, with less wasted effort and more revenue/retention.\n\nKestral works by automatically take in customer data like sales call transcripts & feature request messages and a team of agents:\n1. analyze them for actionable takeaways, deal blockers, and nice to haves\n2. consolidate them and manage all the asks with citations\n3. prioritize them by impact and frequency to cut through the noise so you can see the biggest opportunities clearly\n4. connect them to your existing strategic roadmap so when the work gets done, we can automatically follow back up with your customers and win them over\n\nThis is just step one of our mission to revolutionize how work gets done -- starting with what we choose to work on, and hope you follow us along for the ride!",

    "about": "Attune makes blazingly fast build tools that require zero migration effort.\n\nAs AI enables developers to write code faster than ever, slow builds are increasingly becoming the bottleneck in development velocity. Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\n\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\n\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\n\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

Customers frequently use different identifiers for items, different units, and close but not quite the same descriptors. Employees aren't just copy-pasting (or manually typing) PDF data into an ERP, they have to validate every item in the ERP.\n\nWith Percival, businesses can just email customer POs and other requests to a dedicated @percivaltech.com email address. Once the request is handled, Percival responds to the email with the result: whether that's an order number in the ERP or a list of prices.",

The COO's hair is on fire and we put it out.\n\nOur platform is built on agentic search, connecting across 40+ enterprise integrations - CRMs, email, knowledge bases.\n\nAgents often fail because their underlying context windows are mismatched, leading them to hallucinate. We built enterprise native agentic search to ensure agents have all the context they need to operate fully autonomously.\n\nHere's what Clarm's C-suite buyers use us for:\n\n- a blockchain company to provide an on-demand source of product truth in natural language, reducing alignment meetings by 90%\n- a financial services firm to supercharge their own product by integrating it with the target's enterprise knowledge\n- the top 5 X25 open source startups (by star count) to increase engagement with their Github repo and knowledge base, turning repo visitors into contributors and customers\n- North America's largest fertility clinic to tailor '000s of client support questions with extremely high sensitivity, driving up engagement and turning prospects into committed customers",

They face volatile multi-source income, unique business expenses, and daunting U.S. tax obligations: leading to significant stress, lost time, and missed financial opportunities.\n\nBeluga Labs is building the financial operating system for these modern solopreneurs. Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.",

    "description": "The first AI revenue platform for post-acute healthcare",
    "about": "Post-acute agencies lose up to 15% of revenue each year to denials, non-compliant documentation, and delayed payments. Most treat it as a cost of doing business. Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals—before revenue is lost.\n\nWhile working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors. As payor requirements grow increasingly complex and fragmented, billing has become a manual, error-prone process. Claim Health closes the loop between documentation and billing outcomes—using AI to detect issues, automate workflows, and recover thousands in missed revenue each week.\n\nKevin and JJ bring nearly a decade of experience building and scaling healthtech companies. At Dandy, JJ was a founding engineer and Kevin was the first GTM hire; together they helped grow the business from 0 to $150M+ ARR. At Perry (now Jolly), JJ led engineering and Kevin was Head of Sales, driving the company through a $16.5M Series A led by Tesla’s former CFO.\n\nIn under three weeks since incorporation, we've launched with three agencies and are in early discussions with large U.S. health systems.\n\nPost-acute care is a $400B market with over $20B in annual revenue leakage due to broken billing workflows. Claim Health is fixing that—starting with denials, and expanding into the full revenue cycle stack.",

We enable patients to securely connect their medical records from over 800 healthcare institutions across more than 12,000 locations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. \n\nWe founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\n\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\n\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support — empowering patients to be an active part of their health team. We are a consumer app in beta testing and will be available on the App Store soon!",

Reviewing large volumes of code slows devs down, and increases the chances of bugs slipping through.\n\nThat's why we're building cubic: an intelligent code review platform that helps devs merge PRs 28% faster.\n\nHow? \n- When you open a PR, cubic automatically reviews it. It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\n- You then jump into the cubic platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and cubic generates diagrams of architecture changes.",

Quang lead Product/GTM for Coda Solutions and Fabien is ex-SWE at Meta and lead Engineering at Wealthfront before.\n\nWe’re building Vybe: \"Lovable for internal apps\". We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations (Gmail, Gcal, Github, Jira, etc.), SSO and AI tools (Websearch, Summarization etc.) so anyone in a company can build and launch internal AI-powered apps.\n\nVibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: \n\n1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. \n\n2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins\n\n3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers\n\nSo companies are stuck in the old world: clunky spreadsheets, rigid SaaS solutions or complex no-code tools.\n\nTime to build!",

Weeds steal sunlight and nutrients from crops, forcing farmers to choose between higher costs and lower yields. Moreover, many farms still rely on hand labor to control weed growth. The process is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult due to constant labor shortages (1 out of every 5 US farm positions go unfilled each year). Our robot nicknamed the Field Hand is able to automate one of the worst jobs on a farm and will help healthily feed the world.",

It's like mission control for your customers.\n\nTeam: \nSam (CEO): 2x founder. Led AI Product at Everlywell and early PM at Wonder (now valued at $7bn).

He’s now doing the same for the complexities of customer relationships. Cornell CS alum.\n\nWhy:\nAs B2B companies scale, the founder-level customer intimacy that drives early growth becomes impossible to maintain. Customer context that once fit in a founder's head scatters across systems, logs, and communication channels, drowning teams in noise no human can make sense of. Account managers juggling multiple customers become reactive firefighters, bleeding revenue through missed upsells and preventable churn.

But real work is fluid and messy—spread across tabs, tools, and evolving decisions. Dex transforms your browser into an intelligent, multimodal workspace that understands your intent through voice, text, and action. It enhances familiar interfaces, automates tedious steps, and removes the friction of handoffs.\n\nBeneath the surface, Dex is more than a browser agent — it’s a foundation for:\n\n● Long-term, cross-modal memory grounded in real workflows\n● A new interaction layer to replace static UI with a collaborative canvas \n● Personalization: understanding how individuals approach tasks and navigate software\n\nWe're building the infrastructure for adaptive, intent-aware systems that work the way you do.",

Up to 15 speakers with automatic speaker identification.\n 🎭 Simulations & Personas - end-to-end phone/WebSocket simulations for inbound and outbound agents, with configurable personas (accents, languages, speech & behavior profiles). Define tests as conversations with a graph-based approach, so you can easily branch into edge cases and variants.\n 🔁 Full lifecycle loop - failed calls automatically become repeatable tests, so every failure makes your agent stronger.\n\nRoark is the missing QA layer for Voice AI - helping teams ship agents they can trust.",

It enables recruiters to focus on what matters most and close more placements.",

Ultimately, Woz aims to be the default platform where millions of AI-enabled entrepreneurs launch and scale businesses.\n\nWoz is built by a team of engineers and ML scientists who've worked together building complex AI systems for the last decade.

    "about": "Misprint is an all-in-one marketplace that solves the biggest pain point in the collectibles world: opaque pricing. Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\n\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\n\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\n\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\n\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \n\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\n\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \n\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\n\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies. Our vision is a world where all content, products, and policies are first simulated in an Artificial Society.

    "about": "Riviera builds AI Employees for Hotels. Our first agent is a hotel phone receptionist that lets hotels spend less time answering phone calls and more time helping customers. Our system handles front-desk inquiries, in-room dining orders, and reservations. It answers every question instantly and in any language, 24/7.\n\nWe are solving a problem that older phone systems and IVRs can't: customers hate not being able to talk to someone immediately, but most travel businesses can’t dedicate additional staff to manage phone lines. Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\n\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling them to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.",

    "about": "Waypoint Transit is an AI city planner that generates civil infrastructure studies. Cities spend $50B/year on planning. With Waypoint, cities can generate reports in months rather than years, and at 30% of the cost.\n\nVarun and Ryan met at Stanford, where they graduated with degrees in CS and EE respectively. Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\n\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\n\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $50B/year on planning. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\n\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",

    "about": "At ReJot, we're building a synchronization engine to greatly reduce the complexity of data sharing between backend services within enterprises. The traditional approach is Event Streaming, where events are published to a platform like Kafka. Kafka not only requires significant effort to operate, it also forces engineers to use events. Events come with inherent complexity—they encode something happening rather than something being (i.e., state).\n\nOur approach is based on replication, where state is transferred directly instead of requiring a back-and-forth conversion to events. We provide primitives to enable teams to break data silos, while keeping in mind data ownership and provenance. Teams define what data their backend publishes and requires, and we'll make sure everything is reactively up-to-date. ReJot works on top of existing infrastructure such as Postgres.",

It is 5x faster than other minecraft World Models and was trained with 100x less resources. Our unique insight was relying on aggressive compression in our tokenizer (128x versus the traditional 8x), and because attention scales quadratically with # of tokens our model can run blindingly faster.\n\nNow we’re training a hyper realistic world model!",

PAX moves traders to within nanometers of the exchange – closer than ever before possible.\n\nSuch proximity unlocks unprecedented value to high frequency customers and PAX shares this value by offering zero-fee with cash-back to every other market participant on every trade. PAX is to exchange as Robinhood was to retail brokerage: the first in the industry to “go to zero” and a complete game changer across every asset and geography.\n\nPAX founders, Pete and Ben have spent years working as high-frequency traders, from crypto to traditional markets. Having directly experienced the benefit of electronic trading, they share a belief in its potential to further evolve and create better global markets.",

As a Product team at Revolut, we felt this pain deeply ourselves - we had products ready to launch but stuck in compliance limbo, often for weeks. Turns out, getting compliant took as long as building the product itself. \n\nFrustrated, we dug in and were shocked by how manual and inefficient the processes were. That’s when it clicked: there’s a huge opportunity to automate the boring stuff (and solve our own problem!). Compliance teams win because they ditch the tedious tasks. Product teams win because they ship faster. Everyone’s happy.",

    "about": "careCycle is an AI workforce for medicare agencies and FMOs - helping leading agencies achieve 5x higher conversions, 37% better retention, and saving thousands of agent hours.\n\nWe're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\n\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\n\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\n\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\n\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\n\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.\n\nUsers have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\n\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.\n\nManufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. \n\nCompliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there’s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there’s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce. We’re on a mission to solve this by building the first AI native software for the shop floor. Our vision is to intelligently connect people, robots, and data to 10x today’s manufacturing capacity.",

Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

In the functions where agents aren’t yet intelligent enough to replace humans, they will be soon.\n\nWhen every human function required to operate a software product has an AI agent equivalent, the next step will be within reach: operating an entire company with a team of AI agents instead of humans.\n\nBut superintelligent agents within each function won’t be enough. To operate a software company with 0 human employees, the agents will need to be directed towards common goals, integrated to collaborate across functions, tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics, and trained to make resource allocation decisions.\n\nWe are creating the tools needed to replace the entire org chart of a software company with a team of AI agents. We are developing these tools by owning the products that we automate, because we know from 10+ years of experience building automated systems with AI/ML that integration is the key to unlocking superhuman performance.",

That’s only one of five huge customers we’re set to close in the next few months.\n\nMatan (CEO) worked with security cameras for years, leading video surveillance in the Israel Defense Forces. Tomer (CTO) is a second-time founder and former director of engineering. Our team also includes computer vision experts from Israel’s elite 8200 intelligence unit and former top officials from the Mossad.\n\nThe problem with existing solutions is that they offer low customization, as they’re limited to pre-defined parameters (like shirt color or license plate number). This lack of flexibility causes missed critical events, too many false alarms, and countless hours wasted on manual footage review. Conntour solves this by offering unlimited customization through natural language queries - just ask anything.",

    "about": "Candor helps defense and deeptech companies navigate the government procurement process with AI. We inject agents into the procurement process - agents that not only surface opportunities but actively pursue them - giving anyone the same capabilities as large contractors. \n\nWhen we met at Stanford 4 years ago, it was rare for startups to work with the US Government. In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they’ve been in decades. \n\nAs fellows in Stanford’s Center for National Security Innovation, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \n\nHowever, we’ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\n\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\n\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.",

    "about": "Quantstruct automatically creates and improves product documentation, implementation guides, and changelogs for API & SDK products, web-based enterprise software, and internal applications.\n\nQuantstruct identifies gaps in your knowledge base based on each product release or unfulfilled customer query. It uses multiple AI agents to search existing knowledge sources, test existing docs for validity and style guidelines, and clicks, scrolls, and uses enterprise software through a web browser to generate docs with embedded screenshots and video recordings. Quanstruct is available as a cloud service to start, targeting technical writers, content writing, professional services, and product teams.\n\nTraditional generative AI tools risk hallucinating critical API & SDK fields, even with RAG based approaches. Purely agent-based approaches risk providing unpredictable output that can diverge from desired documentation processes. Finally, no company’s review and publishing workflow is the same. Quantstruct is the easiest way to onboard and customize AI agents to continuously improve your documentation based on your customer needs and product evolution. https://quantstruct.com",

Friday is building the assistant that learns how to predict the action that you will take on your emails, and does it for you.\n\nToday's email products try to help you go through your emails a little faster, but if you have to get through 1000 emails, those products doesn't do much for you. \n\nThe reality is, most of the emails you get don't require you to personally look at them. Friday completely eliminates the need to check those emails, and handles them all at once for you, immediately. \n\nFriday is here to file away spam, sift through newsletters for important tidbits, text you important notifications, and reply to mundane emails, so that no matter how many thousands of emails are in your inbox, you'll just be left with the few emails that actually require your personal touch.\n\nGetting this right is difficult, so everyone else settles with trying to help you go through your email twice as fast. If you want to go 100x as fast, you shouldn't spend even a second on useless emails. \n\nFriday gets this right, bringing the elite experience of having a professional assistant to the entire world.",

However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.\n\nAs AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.",

Our customers can evaluate 10x more deals and fund better companies which leads directly to better returns/more alpha.\n--\n\nOur system is the first of its kind to instantly generate complex, comprehensive data packs from raw data in any format, directly from the data room. This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\n--\n\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows. This isn’t just automation—it’s a purpose-built solution that uncovers actionable insights, fueling smarter decisions and driving true alpha.",

Our infrastructure is built to accelerate research: fast iteration loops, real-time feedback, and direct connection between ideas and outcomes.\n\nWe’re starting with liquid markets like equities and options - high-dimensional, dynamic systems where traditional pipelines break down. Our goal isn’t just to model them better - it’s to build a platform for experimentation, where every result tightens the loop between theory and practice.\n\nIf you care about learning systems, clean abstractions, and applying research in the wild - we’re hiring.",

It can complete tasks across internal tools and 300+ apps using MCP servers, such as Apollo, Slack, Gmail, Notion, etc. It can take over many self-contained tasks, giving your team longer legs to run faster. It runs entirely in the cloud. This means that you can have swarms of agents completing hundreds of tasks while you’re focusing on what really matters.\n\nYou can connect Zero to the applications you use or your custom MCP servers, and then just give it any task and watch it work for you. Zero is engineered to think deeply, execute complex tasks, and even maintain a personalized memory of your interactions.\n\nA few notable features:\n- Built-in autonomy levels, permissions, guardrails, and human approvals\n- Custom instructions to teach Zero how to do things your way\n- Automations e.g. run a task every day or whenever I receive an email\n- Connect to your custom MCPs\n- Connect to 300+ apps with one-click integrations\n- Natively integrates deep research and browser use",

Think of us like Zapier plus Cursor for data engineering.\n\nHere’s how we’re different:\n\n• All-in-one: You can get started in 2 minutes – no setup or configuration required. We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds. Git and branching are built-in for both code and data, so you can time-travel backwards when things break. You can start with GBs and grow to TBs.",

And they’re working with a single agent and context window instead of one in every cell.\n\nAnd Riveter’s web browsing can go further—even reading PDFs and images that may contain answers. \n\nWith Riveter, anyone can automate complex, auditable web research… without coding. \n\nOur founding team brings deep product and engineering expertise from to YC-backed companies Gusto, Retool, and Middesk.",

Companies like 11x and OfOne use us to run simulated tests, analyze production calls, and fix bugs in their voice agents. \n\nWe were both voice agent developers at PlayHT – and, in order to find bugs in our agents, we would spend countless hours manually calling them and listening to conversation recordings. So, we’ve decided to build a platform that does this automatically. \n\nFixa shows developers exactly where and how their agents mess up – enabling them to pinpoint root causes and fix them faster.",

Our R&D is guided by AI models trained on high-density multimodal mouse data generated in-house.\n\nWe are 3 Oxford-trained neuroscientists supported by an experienced SAB from Harvard, Science Corp (ex-Neuralink), EPFL, Meta, and UCL.\n\nIn 1.5 months since landing in SF, we went from nothing to (1) opening and operating an animal lab in South SF, (2) obtaining a proof-of-concept in mice, (3) building a multimodal AI model that directs our screening approach and (4) submitting two provisional patents; all while utilizing less than 50% of our YC funding.",

Organizations can deploy these agents for any care delivery workflow, such as calling patients to check-in on their symptoms, rescheduling a clinician’s panel in case of an emergency, and filling late cancellation slots with other patients.",

Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \n\nWe reduce \n\n- Manual work by 60%\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \n\nWhy Now?\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\n\nTeam:\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\n• Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\n• Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\n• All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\n• Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\n• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\n• And more...\n\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

    "about": "At Village Labs, we help America's businesses become employee owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). \n\nESOPs are a federal retirement plan that enable businesses to give their employees a stake in the company in exchange for significant tax benefits. \n\nWith 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing \"Silver Tsunami\" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.\n\nBy selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. \n\nThousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned.",

Traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores rely on sales associates to provide personalized customer service, guide product discovery and close sales, but it's always been too expensive and unscaleable for online stores. We're building video-based AI agents that are experts in their products and can gently steer customers to a purchase, delighting customers and lifting conversion/AOV.\n\nJerry and Jeffrey are brothers who previously worked together to scale The Coding School to a 6mil+ in revenue. Jerry built software to help run the 50+ Shopify brands that Openstore acquired more profitably and efficiently. He was also an engineer at Flexport and Google.\n\nJeffrey previously worked at DRW as a quant trader, and as an engineer at Facebook, Snowflake and Amazon.",

We generate synthetic, photorealistic training data to help factories catch flaws before they ship. No manual labeling, no real defects required. Our models deploy to edge hardware and integrate easily into existing automation stacks.\n\nWe come from the self-driving world (Argo AI, Uber ATG, Stack AV), where we built reliable perception in high-noise, real-world environments. We're applying that experience to manufacturing: robust sensing, user-friendly interfaces, and fast iteration cycles.\n\nManufacturers hesitate to adopt new sensing due to data concerns, integration risk, and poor UX. We’ve handled petabytes of regulated autonomy data — and built systems that earn trust.\n\nLegacy vendors like Keyence and FLIR offer hardware-centric tools with bloated pricing and outdated software. We’re building the opposite: flexible, modern tools that engineers want to use.\n\nManufacturing is in the middle of a $700B automation wave across North America.

    "description": "The First AI Infrastructure Layer for America’s Empty Truck Space",
    "about": "Oway is an AI-driven marketplace that turns America’s empty truck space into a new category of freight shipping. Every year 50% of U.S. truck space goes unused, a $100B+ inefficiency. Oway uses AI to automatically price, match, and sell that space in real time, giving businesses freight shipping that is dramatically faster and cheaper than traditional options. \n\nWe're building the largest decentralized network of America’s empty truck space - a transparent infrastructure layer any shipper, broker, or carrier can plug into. For shippers, this means freight costs that are up to 50% lower than traditional LTL (shipments from 1 to 12 pallets), along with faster delivery windows because freight moves directly from dock to dock without the slow handoffs, warehouses, or cross-docking infrastructure that LTL depends on. For carriers, Oway’s integration can increase annual revenues by up to 30% with minimal impact on existing schedules. They simply earn more by monetizing space that would have gone unused.\n\nOur mission is to transform empty truck space into an asset that strengthens U.S. competitiveness. By lowering the cost of goods sold, we help businesses grow. By improving carrier margins, we make trucking more sustainable. And by digitizing and decentralizing freight, we are laying the foundation for a resilient, transparent logistics layer that can support America’s reindustrialization in the decades ahead. Oway makes freight shipping as simple as ridesharing - click a button, book a truck, and move goods at the true cost of available capacity.",

Like getting married, moving, having a baby, or losing a parent.\nUnlike traditional wealth management tools or online estate platforms that produce static legal documents, Elayne is dynamic, intelligent, and built not just to delight, but to comfort and guide you when it matters most.\n\nI started Elayne after my mom passed away and I had to settle her estate, accounts, and affairs - essentially, I suddenly had to untangle all the details of her life. It was shocking how fragmented and opaque the process was and how I spent hundreds of hours chasing documents, coordinating accounts, filling legal gaps, and navigating unfamiliar systems, all while grieving and working full time. It shouldn’t be that way.\n\nIn the future, you could hire an attorney, download DIY legal forms, fax and mail physical documents, sync 10 different fintech apps, use a financial planner, spend thousands in fees, and hope it all holds together. Or, you could just use Elayne.",

With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.\n\nWhy us? (1) We're obsessed with reclaiming what's rightfully yours: Kamal and Anthony grew up in Lebanon, where people's money was unfairly taken away. (2) Weijie was the lead infra engineer for Wish's recommendation system, the feature that fueled their IPO. Our combined experience includes Apple, Addepar, Bolt, Wish, and StackAdapt.\n\nAnd we're all working towards one goal: move those billions of dollars where they belong.",

Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the best cash exchange rates or ATMs on your next trip. With Moreta, paying local merchants is easy, and the best part? Transparent fees.\n\nWe came up with Moreta while on our own backpacking adventures. Watching locals pay with a simple scan while we fumbled with cards and cash. So, we created a solution. By syncing with local payment networks, Moreta lets you pay like a local securely and digitally, without needing a bank account in every country.\n\nWe’re starting in Asia, where QR code digital wallets are taking over and are now the top choice at checkout. As these wallets start to join forces for cross-border payments, Moreta will be the first to bridge the gap for international travelers from card-centric markets to seamlessly tap into these local networks. Moreta will target 67 million travelers arriving in the region each year, who together have $127 billion in everyday expenditure.",

Users stay on calls for multiple hours everyday where they depend on Focus Buddy to:\n• Avoid procrastination and get started: Address hidden anxieties, embrace imperfection, chunk tasks, kickstart with mini-goals, and use regular check-ins to maintain momentum.\n• Recover from distractions and stay focused: Focus Buddy detects when they are working on less important tasks or scrolling on social media, help them overcome the underlying concerns feeding the distraction, and help them get back to the important task\n• Manage stress and Prevent Burnout: Focus Buddy detects stress buildup, integrates mindfulness habits to the workflow, helps take short rejuvenating breaks, and stay composed.\n\nOur Initial ICP is people with ADHD who are highly motivated but also highly blocked by internal and environmental factors. In the future, we believe each worker should have their own personal coach that enforces proven productivity techniques in real time to help them extract more focused hours every day with the same effort.",

This enables SMB installers to drastically cut down the pre-installation phase of home energy projects—from several weeks to just minutes. By leveraging LiDAR for spatial analysis, computer vision for automated assessment, and AI for system recommendations, we streamline the entire workflow. This results in a time reduction of up to 90%, enabling installers to confidently transition to and scale up sustainable home energy solutions.",

Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable.

    "description": "AI automating post-purchase operations and support for e-commerce",
    "about": "E-commerce brands rely on disconnected, outdated systems to manage everything after the buy button. From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\n\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\n\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\n\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.",

    "about": "Hi - Mark and Gab here!\n\nWe met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, where we built a $200 million specialty finance business line. At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance—all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\n\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\n\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had—an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. \n\nOur mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\n\nThe operational cost of servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",

    "description": "Drone detection for US defense and national security",
    "about": "The rise of low-cost commercial drones has introduced a new class of asymmetric threats to U.S. national security. Off-the-shelf platforms now deliver ISR, contraband, or payloads with precision, while operating below radar coverage and beyond line-of-sight. These systems—often costing under $1,000—are capable of neutralizing multi-million-dollar defense assets. For drone detection to be viable at scale, sensors must achieve cost parity with the threat.\n\nIn response, the Department of Defense established multiple initiatives to counter the rapid proliferation of uncrewed aerial systems. The Joint Counter-small UAS Office (JCO) coordinates policy and acquisition across services. The Base Defense Cross-Functional Team enables persistent perimeter security for CONUS and OCONUS installations. Falcon Peak, Red Sands, and related exercises are accelerating deployment of counter-UAS technologies in complex environments.\n\nThis threat is no longer exclusive to military operations overseas. It now directly targets the U.S. homeland. In 2025, an executive order designated the protection of American airspace sovereignty a national priority, recognizing that uncrewed systems present both surveillance and kinetic risks within the United States. That same year, a domestic extremist plotted to destroy a Tennessee power substation using a drone rigged with C-4 explosives—a plan disrupted by undercover federal agents. In July 2025, an unauthorized drone collided with a rescue helicopter during disaster response operations in Kerr County, Texas, forcing an emergency landing and halting flood relief efforts. These are not isolated incidents—they reflect a broader shift in drone-enabled threats against homeland infrastructure and public safety.\n\nGuardian RF builds passive, radiofrequency-based drone detection systems for force protection and critical infrastructure defense inside the United States. Our systems are fielded under an AFWERX Direct-to-Phase-II SBIR with the 30th Security Forces Squadron at Vandenberg Space Force Base, deployed by local and state law enforcement, and integrated into commercial security operations. We were selected as a finalist for Falcon Peak 25.2, the Department of Defense’s premier counter-UAS exercise.\n\nScout is a passive RF sensor for fixed, mobile, or temporary deployments. It detects and classifies drone control signals—including modified variants of DJI, Crossfire, and ExpressLRS—at standoff ranges. Scout supports direct integration into TAK and other operational APIs and is managed through GRF-SECURE, our secure interface for live monitoring, threat alerting, and forensic review.\n\nMosaic extends coverage in austere environments, enabling persistent low-altitude monitoring and classification of non–Remote ID drones across complex terrain—without active emissions or mesh dependency.\n\nBuilt in the United States, Guardian RF delivers scalable, automated, and cost-aligned drone detection—passive by design and hardened for real-world deployment across the homeland.",

We generate predictions for mineral deposit shapes and locations, empowering mining companies from initial exploration to advanced feasibility studies.\n\nGeologists need to know precisely where their deposits are because drilling is expensive. In early trials with a lithium mining company, we found that Mineflow predicts the shape of hard rock lithium deposits more than an order of magnitude more accurately than our competitors.\n\nRyan received a BS in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science where he helped teach both the grad-level Deep Learning course and the grad-level Search Engines course. He built ML models at Google in the Display Ads optimization org for 2 years and launched products that generated ~125m USD in ARR.",

Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\n\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.",
